		<h3>establishing the necessity for absolute truth</h3>
		    
		<br>
		    
		<p>Before establishing this necessity, terms must be defined. Firstly, perspective. Perspective is the limited point of view of a person. A person’s perspective is formed from their location, community, family, education, culture, and other variables. Secondly, truth. Truth is that which is fact and reality. Thirdly, relative truth. Relative truth is truth which changes based on a person’s perspective. Finally, absolute truth. Absolute truth is truth which remains constant across any perspective.</p>
		<p>There is a common image used to explain relative truth called the blind men and the elephant. In this image, there are a few blind men surrounding one large elephant. They each touch a different part of the elephant and claim what it is: “it is a snake,” “it is a wall,” “it is a tree,” etc. This does a fairly good job of explaining the concept of relative truth as each blind man has his own perspective which leads to a conclusion that doesn’t match the conclusions of the other blind men. The problem with this image is that it assumes there is an onlooker who isn’t blind and can see the full picture. This onlooker has some sort of enlightenment that enables them to see that what the blind men are touching is an elephant, and that they are all wrong. With this knowledge, this image better portrays the idea of absolute truth, showing that there is an absolute truth that can be seen, but that through relying on your perspective you come to the entirely wrong conclusion. Not partially true, or half correct. Entirely wrong.</p>
		<p>It can also be determined that there is absolute truth by reading the next sentence. It is true that you are reading this sentence. That is an absolute truth. Additionally, it can be determined that there is absolute truth by looking at mathematics. While lots of complex math is theoretical, simple math can be easily observed. Take for example, 1+1=2. Through the traditional example of apples, one apple can be grouped with another apple to make two apples. No matter your perspective, this is always true. Therefore, this is an absolute truth. But there is an additional aspect to absolute truth: it must always be true amid other absolute truths. To elaborate, take 2+2=4. This is an absolute truth for the same reasoning as 1+1=2. When we take these two absolute truths, 1+1=2 and 2+2=4, they are related to and fully complement each other. To rephrase, these two truths are both fully true and do not discredit one another in any way.</p>
		<p>Through this line of thinking, we can come to a set of conclusions. It is necessary for there to be absolute truth. Any absolute truths will be fully true and will not discredit each other in any way. We will revisit this idea later.</p>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		    
		<h3>establishing the necessity for [a] creator(s)</h3>
		    
		<br>
		    
		<p>There are three options for how we see the world. There is either a single creator, multiple creators, or no creator. For now, we will combine “a single creator or multiple creators” into one option of “a creator.” Thus, we have two options: a creator or no creator.</p>
		<p>What does no creator imply? No creator implies that the universe which surrounds us was formed by chance. In other words, an estimated 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was formed from a single incredibly dense fireball that exploded and expanded. This is known as the Big Bang Theory, and would describe what some scientists estimate led to the stars, moons, and planets which surround us, but more importantly, the earth on which we live. This spontaneous and random creation from nothing also would have led to the unique creation of life on some these planets. It is true that there are some microscopic life forms on other planets. But no other life has been observed in the entire universe. Additionally, there are only a handful of observed planets that could possibly support life. But even that is speculation. As far as scientists are aware of, Earth is the only planet that can, has, and continues to support complex life. Not just bacteria, but birds, fish, reptiles, mammals, and human beings. Essentially, that is all which no creator implies: the world we live in is the lucky product of a random explosion billions of years ago and we human beings, who are here by chance, are no different than anything else which surround us. That’s it.</p>
		<p>What does a creator imply? A creator implies that the universe was intricately designed and crafted. Contrary to popular belief, a creator does not actually disagree with the Big Bang Theory. This could be explained through the idea that a creator would have actually initiated the explosion at the beginning of the universe. This single conclusion would alone provide an explanation to how the Earth uniquely supports human life. Not only this, but it would provide a purpose to human life. Many religions differ in what this purpose is, so we will approach the specifics of this later. A creator would also explain uniform laws of nature: gravity, inertia, time, matter, etc. A creator would explain the complexity of the human brain, DNA, and microscopic beings. A creator would explain love, language, family, and friendship. A creator would explain beauty and emotion. This list goes on indefinitely.</p>
		<p>How can things such as these have originated without a creator? From an unexplainable explosion at the beginning of time? One could argue, but I would disagree. It is unfathomable that such a complex network of existence which we are a part of could be originated from chaos without someone or something intricately designing it. Do these arguments ultimately prove that there is a creator? No. However, they personally lead me to the conclusion that there must be a creator.</p>

		<br>
		<br>

		<h3>establishing the necessity for a single creator</h3>
		    
		<br> 
		    
		<p>Resetting our definition of “a creator” leaves us with another set of options: a single creator or multiple creators. In order to establish this necessity, terms must be defined. Creator is a person or thing that brings something into existence. In the context of this discussion, creator is referring to the being(s) which brought the universe into existence. Creator is more often substituted with the word “god,” which can be defined as “supreme or greatest being(s)”. However, arriving at the conclusion that there are multiple supreme or greatest beings is flawed. There cannot be more than one greatest being, otherwise, there would be no greatest being. There are two alternate definitions of god, however, which avoid this flaw.</p>
		<p>The first is that god is not “greatest being,” but instead “greater being”. This would allow for two or more gods to be equal, as long as they are all equally greater than something else. However, this begs the question. How could multiple equal gods exist? They could not have created each other, for one cannot create something equal to it. They could not all be infinite, but would inherently limit each other. Therefore, something would still have to create these equally great beings.</p>
		<p>The second is that there are levels of “status” among multiple gods. This would place one “greatest” being above other “slightly less great” beings. However, this still arrives at the conclusion that there is a single greatest being. The remaining “gods” which are lower than this greatest being are defined in a plethora of ways across religions. Depending on the religion, these gods have beginnings and ends, can be bound by physical locations, and/or have limited power. But ultimately, across all religions, and by definition, these gods must submit to something greater than themselves.</p>
		<p>The flaws in defining multiple gods can ironically be seen throughout polytheistic religions, where despite there being many gods, they are all either just representations of a single god, or are in submission to a single greater god.</p>
		<p>Do these arguments ultimately prove that there is a single creator? No. However, they personally lead me to the conclusion that there must be a single creator, a single God, who may be accompanied by an assortment of spiritual beings which submit to it.</p>

		<br>
		<br>

		<h3>establishing the necessity for a single religion</h3>
		    
		<br> 
		    
		<p>How do we discover who this single creator is? There are over four-thousand religions in the world. Surprisingly, there are only about 11 recognized monotheistic religions in the world. While there could be many more monotheistic religions in the world, they have yet to be discovered, or can be combined with others due to slight regional differences/denominations.</p>
		<p>Let’s first return to absolute truth. We already established that it is necessary for there to be absolute truth. Is God an absolute truth? Well, if God is the creator of all things, then God must be THE absolute truth. If 1+1=2 is an absolute truth, and God created mathematics, then God created this absolute truth. Can the creation be truer than the creator? I would argue the creation can only be equal or less in truth to the creator. Therefore, if 1+1=2 is an absolute truth, which we have established it is such, then the creator must be absolutely true as well. In other words, if creation contains absolute truth, and all creation stems from the creator, then all absolute truth stems from the Creator, thus the Creator must be absolutely true. This is how we arrive at the conclusion that God itself is an absolute truth.</p>
		<p>We also already established that any absolute truths will be fully true and will not discredit each other in any way. Following that same line of thinking, because God is an absolute truth, any “absolutely true” interpretations of God must be fully true and cannot discredit each other in any way.</p>
		<p>So, can all 11 monotheistic religions be true? There are many people who would argue yes. These people would argue that all religions are partially correct, that every religion is only perceiving a small part of God, and ultimately everyone is reaching towards the same God in one way or another. This sounds a lot like the blind men and the elephant, and it is called pluralism. This argument falls on itself in many ways. Firstly, for the same reason as the blind men and the elephant: it argues that we are able to see both the full picture of God and our own narrow perspectives. Secondly, for our definition of absolute truth: any absolute truths will be fully true and will not discredit each other in any way. Therefore, in order for all 11 monotheistic religions to be absolutely true, they would have to not discredit each other in any way. Let’s look at all 11 monotheistic religions to discover if they discredit each other in any way:</p>
		<p>Tenrikyo is a newer Japanese religion which teaches that once someone rejects the evil in themselves and then continuously practices specific dances, rituals, and prayers which are described in their holy book, they will attain perfection and will live a life full of blessing. Tenrikyo would inherently argue that other religions cannot also be correct because they do not follow the specific dances, rituals, and prayers which are described in their holy book.</p>
		<p>Eckankar is a newer religion which teaches that following its teachings is the most direct path to God, but that one can reach God by following any other religions. Eckankar specifically teaches that by performing specific meditation exercises as instructed by its leaders, a person can raise their spiritual IQ and travel across spiritual realms until they unlock their highest potential and find joy beyond measure. While Eckankar claims that all religions lead to God, it internally contradicts itself by giving a method of reaching God that directly goes against many other world religions.</p>
		<p>Vodou is a newer Afro-Haitian religion which teaches that by performing specific prayers and ceremonies for the spirits of God, a person can gain health, protection, and favor. The specific beliefs of Vodou can drastically differ by region due to it being more of an oral tradition than a written religion. Thus, the central belief can be summarized through the teaching that humanity exists to interact with the spirits of God to attain blessings. Due to its very general teachings, it doesn’t necessarily claim itself as a religion. In fact, most of its followers would categorize themselves as “Vodou Catholic” due to the large Catholic influence in the regions where vodou exists. Ironically, the very general Vodou beliefs go against the core beliefs of Catholicism, as well as many other world religions.</p>
		<p>Sikhism is a newer Indian religion which teaches that all people and all religions are equally loved and created by God, and that people have a responsibility to pray, live honestly, and serve others. Sikhism specifically teaches that one must simply practice truth to grow closer to God, but also teaches that one must ultimately do good deeds to be cleansed by God. Only through reincarnation can a person finally merge with God. While Sikhism claims that all religions lead to God, it internally contradicts itself by giving a method of reaching God that directly goes against many other world religions.</p>
		<p>Zoroastrianism is an old Iranian religion which teaches that all people have a choice between good and evil. By choosing to have good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, a person can be righteous and their souls can be accepted into heaven. Zoroastrianism also teaches that through sacrificial rituals and sacred chants, people can be cleansed and made righteous. Zoroastrianism would inherently argue that other religions cannot also be correct because they do not follow the specific rituals and chants which are described in their holy book.</p>
		<p>Hinduism is an old Indian religion which is actually pantheistic, meaning that God is not over all things, but is all things. It teaches that all religions are true paths to God. Hinduism also teaches that each individual is a part of God and has different value based on where they rank in the caste system. It teaches that a person’s soul reincarnates until they have attained perfection. While Hinduism claims that all religions lead to God, it internally contradicts itself by giving a method of reaching God that directly goes against many other world religions.</p>
		<p>Judaism is an old Hebrew religion which teaches that all people are loved and created by God, but they are also naturally wicked. To be cleansed, one must constantly follow specific laws, or make sacrifices when they fail to follow the laws. By doing these good deeds and sacrifices, a person may be able to enter heaven. Additionally, Jews await a messiah to come save them from their wickedness. Judaism would inherently argue that other religions cannot also be correct because they do not follow the specific laws which are described in their holy book.</p>
		<p>Christianity is a Hebrew and Greek religion which similarly follows the beliefs of Judaism, except teaches that a specific man named Jesus is the Messiah, is God in human form. Christianity teaches that Jesus died on behalf of all people, acting as the final sacrifice for a people who will always fail to follow the laws established in Judaism. By believing in Jesus, his death, and his resurrection, a person no longer has to perfectly follow the laws or perform sacrifices in order to enter heaven, as Jesus did this on their behalf. Therefore, anyone who believes in Jesus, his death, and his resurrection will enter heaven. Christianity emphasizes that only Jesus can “save” a person from their own wickedness, that the Jewish laws and sacrifices are not sufficient. Christianity also teaches that Jesus will return one day to bring all of his people to heaven. Christianity would inherently argue that other religions cannot also be correct because they do not believe in and follow the specific person of Jesus and his teachings.</p>
		<p>Rastafari is a newer Jamaican religion which similarly follows the beliefs of Judaism, except teaches that a specific man named Selassie is the Messiah, is God in human form. It teaches that the country of Ethiopia is heaven, and that those who are black will one day rule the world over those who are white. This is because those who are black are God’s chosen people. Rastafari would inherently argue that other religions cannot also be correct because they do not believe in and follow the specific person of Selassie and his teachings.</p>
		<p>Islam is a middle eastern religion which similarly follows the beliefs of Judaism, except teaches a different set of laws. In order to make up for a bad deed or failure to uphold a law, a person must do another good deed or an act of charity. By doing this, a person can remain righteous and can then enter heaven. Islam would inherently argue that other religions cannot also be correct because they do not follow the specific laws which are described in their holy book.</p>
		<p>Baha’I Faith is a middle eastern religion which teaches that all religions of the world are different ways that God has revealed itself to the world. To rephrase, it teaches that that all religions are true. It teaches that all people can get closer to God over time by performing good deeds, even as spirits in the afterlife. It teaches that the goal of humanity is to build a new global civilization of universal peace. While The Baha’I Faith claims that all religions are true, it internally contradicts itself by giving a method of reaching God that directly goes against many other world religions.</p>
		<p>So, can all 11 monotheistic religions be true? According to their own beliefs: no. Each religion either directly or indirectly claims that it is the only correct religion, or claims that all religions lead to God while teaching laws, rituals, and history that contradict many other world religions. This leads to the conclusion that only a single monotheistic religion can be true.</p>
