                    <p>Howdy! My name is Wyatt James Ferguson. I'm just a guy who loves all kinds of art, problem solving, and learning. I'm originally from Northwest Houston, but am currently a student at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science.</p>

                    <p>I'm also just a guy who claims to be burdened with thought. Through the making and consuming of music, film, animation, stories, and essays, I seek to externalize this burden. My first single is below.</p>

                    <p>This is my first single. Recorded in my college bedroom, it's a song about redemption through Jesus, the Christ. Psalm 139:13 of the Bible states "For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb." The Creator of the Universe is intentional and intimate.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, Psalm 103:14 of the Bible states "For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust." We are all broken, finite people by nature, and we will always go against the infinite goodness our Creator. Yet, our Creator chooses to pursue us, pursue you, with His only Son, Jesus.</p>

    <!-- THE TRUTH -->

                </div>
                    
                <div class="col-12 text-center" id="container">
                        <p>In the beginning, God created the sky and the land, the beautiful nature that surrounds us today. Then, God created humanity in His image. God loves humanity, and at the beginning of time gave us the gift of living an eternal, fulfilling life, with Him. In order to live in this way, humanity had to trust in God to provide. However, the first humans, Adam and Eve, decided to gain wisdom for themselves, instead of letting God provide. This choice of bad exposed the humans to sin, which separated them, and all of humanity, from God. The rest of the story, written through the Bible, is God's passionate work to regain that intimate connection with His creation. This goes through Abraham, Moses, David, and others, ultimately leading to the deliverance of His son to earth, Jesus, the Christ.</p>

                        <p>Jesus is God Himself taking on the tainted form of humanity. Jesus lived a perfect life, teaching others how to truly live and love like Himself, performing miracles to prove His Holiness, and telling all people that He is the way to regain eternal intimacy with God. Ultimately, Jesus suffered at the hand of His own people, those whom He loved, and still loves. Jesus was brutally lashed and nailed to a cross by His beloved creation, willingly taking the death that we all deserve upon Himself. A perfect man dying the most imperfect death. A sacrifice for all of humanity. Jesus, the Christ, bore the unfathomable burden of every single human's sins, past, present, and future. But after three days, Jesus rose back to life, defeating both sin and death, and not only claiming, but proving himself to be God. This sacrifice releases all people who believe in Jesus as God, submitting to Him as Lord, from the shackles of sin, allowing them to return to relationship with God as it was at the beginning of time.</p>
                        
                        <p>Jesus gives all of His followers a beautiful mission: to reach all nations of the earth, declaring His name to all people so that they might be brought back into relationship with Him. Jesus also gives His followers His Spirit, which temporarily regains the intimate connection between man and God. Soon, Jesus, the Christ, will return and restore the world to its purest form: man and God together in perfect harmony. While we wait, it is up to us to spread His name to all peoples of all nations, and live as Jesus instructed: following after His heart.</p>
