                         <p>Howdy! My name is Wyatt James Ferguson. I'm a brand-new Christian singer/songwriter originally from Northwest Houston. I'm also currently a student at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science, something I have been passionate about for a while.</p>

                         <p>I've got a little bit of time till I graduate, so until then I'll just be making some singles here and there while I focus on my studies. Fun fact, my first single is listed right below this!</p>

                    <p>This is my first single! Recorded in my bedroom with the cheapest equipment I could get my hands on, it's a song about the redemption of Christ. Psalm 139:13 states "For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb." How beautiful is it that we were knitted together by The Creator of the Universe?!?</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, Psalm 103:14 states "For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust." Our Creator knows that we are broken people, that we will always go against His goodness. Yet, He chooses to pursue us with His only Son, Jesus Christ.

    <!-- THE TRUTH -->
     <section class="other section-padding" id="truth">
          <div class="container">
               <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12" id="container">

                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="col-12" id="container">
                         <p>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, the beautiful nature that surrounds us today. Then, God created man and woman in His image, naming them Adam and Eve. God loved them as a potter loves their clay, and He wanted them to reciprocate that love. But a forced love isn’t truly love, therefore God gave them the choice to love Him, or choose self-gratification. Being tempted by Satan, who offered them “something greater,” and on behalf of all of humanity, they didn’t choose God. This caused immediate separation of man from connection with God, as they are now unholy from their disobedience, and God, being perfectly Holy, cannot co-exist with an unholy humanity. The rest of the story, written through the Bible, is God's passionate work to regain that intimate connection with His creation. This goes through Abraham, Moses, David, and others, ultimately leading to the deliverance of His son to earth, Jesus Christ.</p>

                         <p>Jesus is God Himself taking on the tainted form of humanity. Jesus lived a perfect life, teaching others how to truly live and love like Himself, performing miracles to prove His Holiness, and bringing joy to all. Ultimately, however, Jesus suffered at the hand of His own people, those whom He loved, and still loves. Jesus was brutally lashed and nailed to the cross by His beloved creation, willingly taking the death that we all deserve upon Himself. A perfect man dying the most imperfect death. This death is not only physical but spiritual; Jesus Christ bore the impossible burden of every single sin, past, present, and future. But after three days, Christ threw off all of those burdens, crushing them into dust, releasing all people who believe in Him from the shackles of sin, and rising up from the grave to declare Himself as God.</p>
                         
                         <p>Christ gives all of us a beautiful mission: to reach all nations of the earth, declaring His name to all people. Christ also sends us His spirit, temporarily regaining the intimate connection between man and God. However, it is still up to man to accept that intimate relationship with their Savior. Soon, Jesus Christ will return and restore the world to its purest form: man and God together in perfect harmony. While we wait, it is up to us to spread His name to all peoples of all nations, and live as Jesus instructed His people: following after His heart.</p>
